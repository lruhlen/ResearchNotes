Peter's code can't Converge a model when it starts Out w/ using the D outer = ID Matrix.
Also, Can NOT Converge the altered up 1e3 eos table runs unless you Let it apply dL values that are as Large as it wants. Even then, it converges to a kind of strange, very luminous result. 
If you limit the size of the d Ls that can be applied in that case, the model (probably?) never converges.
So, the requirements for proper model conveyance are: 
1) you HAVE to start out / always use the full numerical calculations for the outer CD EG values.
2) you HAVE to get the density lookups right.

Note that Peter's code + full D outer Calcs + 1e3 altered UP eostable
produces results that come the closest to reproducing what Helena currently does. (At least, after 1 iteration.) (Helena has not yet successfully converged ANY models.) 

I believe that the key to getting Helena to work will be figuring out how to fix its density Over-estimation issue. 
EVEN THOUGH the density over-estimation causes much Less difference b/w the iter #1 dX profiles the two codes calculate WHEN Peter's code alwayS uses the D outer = ID matrix Condition, BOTH ARE WRONG and unworkable for producing a converged result . 
In other words, they are agreeing in their misbehavior in this case. It looked like a promising step towards agreement b/w the two codes, but all it actually proves is that I can get Peter's code to go off the rails in the same way that Helena currently is. 

The good news here is that the SAME mechanism that hobbles Peter's code (as just described above) is also the culprit in Helena . So, I *think* that if I get the right densities going in Helena, it will behave (read: succeed) more like Peter's code does when it's trying to move a model towards convergence.
