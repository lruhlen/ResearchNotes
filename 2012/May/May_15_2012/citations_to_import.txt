Question: how could we try to detect Kuiper belt/Oort clouds around 
other stars?  And, what could that tell us about planet formation in those
systems?  And, what dynamical effects do the Kuiper belt/ Oort cloud
objects have (if any) on the closer-in planets in those systems?
Could we make predictions using the Henyey + Nbody code
about what we might see?  Think about this more, it could be interesting
and useful...

Off the subject question for myself: 
truly random number generation through 
observations of atomic nuclear decay?  Or
through cosmic ray detections or something?

What's the difference b/w oligarchic and runaway 
planetesimal growth?

What, precisely, is a corotation resonance?

Planet finding microlensing surveys?
How does this technique work, and what
have been its results thus far?  And what are 
the names, if any, of said surveys?
